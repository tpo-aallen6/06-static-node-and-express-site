# 06-static-node-and-express-site

This project is a static node and express site using pug templates that listens at localhost:3000. 

I changed some css styling in the script.js file.
Styles changed: background colors on certain areas of each page (lightcyan instead of white), text color (black instead of gray), and added shadow boxes to each project icon. I also added back buttons for each error page (404 and 500) to return the user to the home page. 

Added the start script to package.json so npm start or node app.js serves the app.

All dependencies can be installed by entering npm install.
